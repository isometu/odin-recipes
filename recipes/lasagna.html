        <p>Lasagna is a classic recipe that every cook should have it in their rotation.</p>
        
        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>The best lasagna recipe is made with ingredients that you know, and it is not difficult at all! All you need for this recipe is one pan, one bowl and a 9x13 baking dish.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Cheese Filling:</b> For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains;
                <ul>
                    <li>ricotta</li>
                    <li>parmesan</li>
                    <li>seasonings</li>
                    <li>parsley (couple of tablespoons)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Meat:</b> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef. If using all beef, add a quarter of tablespoon of fennel seeds and some seasoning to the meat.</li>
            <li><b>Sauce:</b> To keep this sauce quick, i use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it is easy to make with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you prefer).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Lasagna ingredients don't have to be limited to the ones you see here. Substitute meats or different cheeses or different meat sauces could be tried.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <p>Lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy and it is definitely worth your time.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Boil pasta:</b> Cook in a large pot of salted water.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare meat sauce:</b> Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce and simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
            <li><b>Combine cheese mixture:</b> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
            <li><b>Layer &amp; bake:</b> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9x13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
            <li>Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
